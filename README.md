## Overview

Backyard Wizard is a map-first, AI-powered landscape maintenance platform that generates dynamic, hyperlocal maintenance schedules based on actual plants, microclimate, phenology, and trusted extension guidanceâ€”all using free, open data sources.

### Core Innovation

**Video-based plant identification + geospatial mapping + phenology-aware rule engine = personalized weekly task lists**

---

## The Problem

Homeowners with mixed landscapes (lawn, trees, shrubs, perennials, vegetable beds) don't know what to do, when, and where. Advice is fragmented and date-based, not tailored to their exact plants, microclimate, or soil.

## The Solution

Backyard Wizard identifies plants from on-site video, places them on a geospatial map of your property, and auto-generates a dynamic maintenance calendar driven by:

- Local weather and forecasts
- Plant phenology (biological timing)
- Soil characteristics
- Plant-specific best practices from trusted university extension sources

---

## Key Features

### Phase 0: Prototype (Weeks 1-4)
- Interactive property mapping with zone drawing
- Manual plant assignment from curated catalog
- Weather integration with Growing Degree Days
- Basic rule engine with 20 lawn/tree/shrub tasks
- Weekly task list generation

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 5-16)
- AI-powered plant identification from video
- Expanded catalog (200+ species)
- Phenology integration (USANPN)
- Advanced task management with calendar sync
- 150+ maintenance rules with extension citations

### Phase 2: Enrichment (Weeks 17-28)
- Soil characteristics integration
- Pest and disease models
- Seasonal PDF exports
- Regional customization

### Phase 3: Pro/Scale (Weeks 29+)
- Multi-property management
- Team collaboration
- Community templates
- Optional smart home integrations
